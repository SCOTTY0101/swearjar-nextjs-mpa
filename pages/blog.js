                <p>Who am I and what do I do?
                <br />
                I am a Self-taught Front-End developer and work part-time on my own projects or Open Source.
                In 2018, I was working for a company and got interested in how hardware and software work together. That was an introduction to Arduino {"Uno’s "} and The C language. After six months of learning to code, I came across JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In 2019 I started writing Frontend code.

                <br />
                <p>
                Why I code?
                <br />
                I am technically minded, and I prefer to keep my brain busy with problem solving.
                I enjoy the challenges of coding and writing software. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                Why JavaScript?
                <br />
                {"It's"} relatively easy to learn and whither{"it's"} a good or bad a thing, but JavaScript is everywhere. Want to work Frontend with Web or Mobile {"App’s"}?
                Try React and React Native.
                Need files or data to the client-side or servers? JSON.  Back-end code with {"API's"}? NodeJS.
                In need of data base stoage, then try MongoDB.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                Why the name “SwearJar”?
                <br /> 
                If anyone has tried their hand at coding, it comes from the challenges of writing clean code, that is bug free and works.
                {"It's "}an ongoing journey of none stop learning....and filling up the swear jar.
